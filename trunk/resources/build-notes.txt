::clover::
If you plan on using clover, the following element needs to be added to your maven 'settings.xml' (see resources/conf/settings.xml):

  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>profile-clover</id>
      <activation>
        <property>
          <name>profile</name>
          <value>clover</value>
        </property>
      </activation>
      <properties>
        <cloverLicense>[specify-location-of-clover.license]</cloverLicense>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>

To run clover:
$mvn clover2:instrument clover2:aggregate clover2:clover -P profile-clover

A report will be generated in the following directory:
./target/site/clover/

 'duracloud.home' should be defined in your maven 'settings.xml' (see resources/conf/settings.xml):
  
  <properties>
    <duracloud.home>[location-of-writable-duracloud-directory]</duracloud.home>
    ...
